The program takes 3 non-negative integral arguments representing average
arrival time, average stay time, and average loop count respectively. To cause
the bathroom to change genders frequently, use a larger number like 50 for the
first argument and a smaller number like 2 for the second argument. All
arguments must be non-negative and the final argument must also be non-zero.

Example: make && ./project3 50 2 5

No thread can enter the bathroom when a member of the other sex is in the
bathroom because it can disallow traffic in/out of the bathroom through the use
of the "doorLock" mutex while it checks both the number and gender of bathroom
users. In the case that the thread's gender is the same as the bathroom's or
the bathroom is empty, the thread enters the bathroom, converts the bathroom to
its gender, and re-permits bathroom traffic. The bathroom queue is handle by
the "bathroomOccupants" semaphore, which is posted or waited upon when someone
is entering or leaving the bathroom and has the "doorLock" mutex.

Statistics printouts are kept together by requiring that a thread hold the
"printLock" mutex while it prints them and release it when it's done.
