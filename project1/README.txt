Everything works and outputs exactly as specified. I even went the extra step
of supporting quoted arguments and backslash escapes with the same behaviour as
bash.  But that was just for my own personal amusement.

Testing was done both by using the test-shell{,2} files as stdin for the
shell{,2} executables and by manual input with manual output sanity checks.
