Everything should be working as specified in the assignment.
From run to run, each field may change except `state`, and `comm`.
`comm` may change, but only after a file rename. `uid` will only
change when a different user executes the program. `start_time`
monotonically increases, so it will never be repeat (except after
integer overflow) as long as runs that are more than a second apart.
